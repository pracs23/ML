Conditional probability	In probability theory, conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event occurring given that another event has (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) occurred.
Naive assumptions	The assumpiot that assume probabilities are independent.
Posterior probabilities	Posterior probabilities are what we inferred after we knew that R occurred
Prior probabilities	Prior probabilities are what we knew before we knew that R occurred.
Sensitivity	How often a test correctly gets a positive result for the condition that's being tested for (also known as the “true positive” rate).The true-positive recognition rate
Specificity	The proportion of truly negative cases that were classified as negative. The true-negative recognition rate
